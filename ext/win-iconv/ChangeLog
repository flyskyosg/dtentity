2007-11-28  Yukihiro Nakadaira

	* win_iconv.c: bug fix for two things (Tor Lillqvist)
	1) This is probably not important: Add a function
	   must_use_null_useddefaultchar() that checks for those
	   codepages for which the docs for WideCharToMultiByte() say
	   one has to use a NULL lpDefaultChar pointer. Don't know if
	   this is actually needed, but better to be safe than sorry.
	2) This is essential: In kernel_wctomb(), the code should first
	   check if bufsize is zero, and return the E2BIG error in that
	   case.
